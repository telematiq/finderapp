Aggregator News - RSS Reader

About this app

Aggregator News is an RSS Feed Reader to read news for free, quickly, without ads.

The application allows you to quickly aggregate information from various sources, 
enabling you to have all the news grouped and organized in one place. 
Unlike social networks, where article priority is determined by algorithms, 
in this app, news remains in chronological order.

GOALS

1. Quickly stay informed, saving time by avoiding checking dozens of websites.
2. Enjoy a distraction-free and ad-free interface.
3. Receive personalized news based on your interests.

FREE

The application is completely free, without ads and registration.

CONFIGURATION

In the initial setup and settings, customize language and followed 
topics: sports, motors, travel, music...

SOURCES

You can add other sites by searching for the address or checking 
popular/recommended ones.

COMPATIBILITY

You can follow all sites that support RSS/ATOM. If a site doesn't 
support it, you can use its Google News address.

LAYOUT

By default, news is displayed in a scrollable list. Alternatively, 
you can view one article per page with an image, title, and description.

PRIVACY

The app is private, saving preferences locally, requiring no email 
or account. No data is stored elsewhere.

CATEGORIES

You can categorize followed sites into different tabs on the main screen.

LISTS

Through "read later" and "favorites," you can save articles for later viewing.

SHARING

Through "copy link" and "share," you can send news to other apps and people.

OFFLINE

Without internet, you can continue to view previously downloaded content.

CUSTOMIZATION

In settings, customize colors, language, news limit, dark mode, images, and more.

FILTERS

Exclude news containing specific words through settings and parental control.

UNDER THE HOOD

News is retrieved from the internet via HTTP requests from RSS feeds, 
similar to Google News. Essential information (title, date, time) is 
extracted from XML and saved locally in an SQLite database. 
Images and descriptions are retrieved from site metadata, similar to WhatsApp.

TECHNOLOGIES

Language: Dart, Framework: Flutter, Design: Material Design 3

OPTIMIZATION

The application is built to use minimal internet, loading thousands 
of news in a few MB by reading only textual data. To minimize network 
requests, the cache is used and automatically emptied after a few hours. 
Old articles are automatically deleted.

PERFORMANCE

Loads hundreds of sites in a few seconds. Network requests are made in 
parallel, any offline sites are ignored, and there's a maximum connection 
time for slow ones.

BATTERY

Thanks to the absence of background processes, syncs, and notifications, 
the app doesn't consume battery once closed by the user.

MIGRATIONS

Through OPML import/export, you can transfer feeds to other devices or 
migrate from other RSS readers.
